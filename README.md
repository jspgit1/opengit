<a href="deploy_ML_project_with_docker_image.ipynb">deploy_ML_project_with_docker_image.ipynb</a>
<p>This deployment will build a Docker image with install dlib,face_recognition and a lot of modules.<br>
Our face recognition model is based on Dlib and KNN. A set of face images were used to train the KNN model.</p>

<p>This notebook explains face rectangle data type and from from dlib hog detector, dlib cnn detector, OpenCV Haar Cascade detector, face_recognition.face_locations and
mtcnn.detect_faces() </p>

## 3 face_recognition_multiclass_CNN_model.ipynb
<a href="face_recognition_multiclass_CNN_model.ipynb">face_recognition_multiclass_CNN_model.ipynb</a>
<p>This model is built upon on keras and OpenCV. It can be trained with certain image data structure. It counts classes automatically and converts class name to a binary label array. It illustrates training accuracy vs epochs.</p>
